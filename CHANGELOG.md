# Changelog

All changes relative to the upstream [`docker/full-keycloak-auth`](https://gitlab.com/panoramax/server/api/-/tree/develop/docker/full-keycloak-auth) example.

---

## Pre-built image

**`docker-compose.yml`** — replaced the `x-base-geovisio` build anchor (which pointed at the API source tree) with `image: panoramax/api:${GEOVISIO_IMAGE_TAG:-latest}`. This decouples the deployment repo from the API source code so it can be maintained independently. The image is published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/panoramax/api).

**`env.example`** — uncommented and clarified `GEOVISIO_IMAGE_TAG` so operators can pin to a specific release.

## Coolify platform compatibility

Coolify has several constraints that differ from plain Docker Compose:

- **Named networks removed** — Coolify does not support custom named networks in compose files; the default bridge network is used instead.
- **`deploy.replicas` replaced with explicit services** — Coolify ignores `deploy.replicas`, so the single `background-worker` service with `deploy.replicas: 4` was replaced with four explicitly named services (`background-worker-1` through `background-worker-4`).
- **Bind mounts replaced with baked-in files** — Coolify resolves bind mount paths relative to the Docker host, not the helper container, so files that were bind-mounted into images (`nginx.conf`, `robots.txt`, `1-init-keycloak-db.sh`, `keycloak-realm.json`) are now copied into their respective images at build time via the Dockerfiles.
- **`restart: no` on migrations** — Coolify injects `restart: unless-stopped` on all services; without an explicit override the `migrations` service (which exits 0 on success) would restart in a tight loop.
- **Image tag conflict resolved** — removed the named `panoramax/api:local` tag from the build anchor; BuildKit was persisting the tag across Coolify redeployments and causing conflicts.
- **Traefik labels added** — internal services (`auth`, `api`, `background-worker-*`) have `traefik.enable=false` so Coolify/Traefik does not try to route public traffic directly to them; all external traffic flows through nginx.
- **`exclude_from_hc: true`** on `migrations` and `background-worker-*` — tells Coolify not to include these services in its deployment health gate (migrations exits intentionally; workers have no HTTP health endpoint).

---

## Nginx and proxy fixes

- **Port 80** — changed nginx from port 8080 to port 80 so Traefik's default routing works without configuration.
- **Host port binding removed from `reverseproxy`** — Traefik routes to the internal port; exposing it on the host caused conflicts.
- **RFC 7239 `Forwarded` header stripped** — Traefik sets the `Forwarded` header (RFC 7239) but without a port, which caused Keycloak's `ForwardedHeadersParser` to log errors and misidentify the request origin. nginx now strips it before forwarding to Keycloak: `proxy_set_header Forwarded "";`
- **`Host` header added to `/oauth` proxy block** — ensures Keycloak sees the correct hostname when constructing redirect URLs.
- **`reverseproxy` healthcheck added** — Coolify needs a health signal before marking the stack healthy.
- **`website` healthcheck added** — `curl -sf http://localhost:3000` so Coolify can gate on the frontend being ready.

---

## Keycloak 26.x compatibility

- **Admin bootstrap variable names updated** — Keycloak 26 renamed the bootstrap admin credentials from `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN`/`KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to `KC_BOOTSTRAP_KEYCLOAK_ADMIN`/`KC_BOOTSTRAP_KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Updated to match upstream; the `.env` variable names (`KEYCLOAK_ADMIN`, `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) are unchanged.
- **`KC_HOSTNAME_PATH: /oauth`** — tells Keycloak it is deployed under the `/oauth` path prefix so it generates correct redirect URLs and asset paths through nginx.
- **`KC_HTTP_MANAGEMENT_HEALTH_ENABLED: "true"`** — enables Keycloak's management health endpoint on port 9000, required for the healthcheck probe.
- **Auth healthcheck updated** — Keycloak 26's management health endpoints are not reliably available in this build configuration. The healthcheck now hits `/oauth/realms/master` over HTTP/1.0, which proves the database is up, the realm is loaded, and Keycloak is serving requests.
- **Login theme fixed** — the `geovisio` Keycloak client had `loginTheme: "base"` which rendered an unstyled login page. Corrected to `"keycloak"`.

---

## S3 object storage

Migrated from local filesystem storage to S3-compatible object storage:

- Replaced the single `FS_URL` environment variable with three separate variables: `FS_TMP_URL`, `FS_PERMANENT_URL`, and `FS_DERIVATES_URL`, allowing each storage tier to be pointed at a different bucket or prefix.
- Added `S3_PERMANENT_PUBLIC_URL` and `S3_DERIVATES_PUBLIC_URL` for serving pictures directly from S3 without proxying through the API.
- Removed local volume mounts for picture storage from the nginx and API services.
- **nginx `/permanent/` and `/derivates/` location blocks removed** — the upstream config served pictures directly from a local `pic_data` volume via these location blocks. With S3 storage those paths are handled by clients going directly to S3 via `S3_PERMANENT_PUBLIC_URL`/`S3_DERIVATES_PUBLIC_URL`, so the blocks and their UUID-to-path rewrite rule are not needed.
- **`FS_URL` explicitly blanked in compose** — the pre-built `panoramax/api` image has `ENV FS_URL="/data/geovisio"` baked in. Setting `FS_URL: ""` in the `migrations`, `api`, and `background-worker-*` environment blocks overrides it so the split S3 variables are used instead.

---

## Keycloak realm hardening

- **Self-registration disabled** — `registrationAllowed: false` in the realm config; accounts must be created by an admin.
- **Email verification required** — `verifyEmail: true` added to the realm config.
- **SMTP configuration** — added `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_SSL`, and `SMTP_STARTTLS` environment variables wired into the Keycloak realm SMTP settings.
- **`API_REGISTRATION_IS_OPEN`** — added to `docker-compose.yml` and `env.example` (defaults to `False`) to surface the registration policy in the website UI and federation metadata.

---

## Required variable enforcement

Variables that have no default and will cause a broken or cryptic deployment if unset are marked with `:?` in `docker-compose.yml`. Docker Compose (and Coolify) will refuse to start and report a clear error listing any missing variables, rather than silently passing empty strings into containers.

Required variables: `DOMAIN`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `KC_DB_PASSWORD`, `PG_PASSWORD`, `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, `FS_TMP_URL`, `FS_PERMANENT_URL`, `FS_DERIVATES_URL`, `S3_PERMANENT_PUBLIC_URL`, `S3_DERIVATES_PUBLIC_URL`.

SMTP variables (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`) are left as optional bare variables — Keycloak starts without them, email just won't work until configured.

---

## Miscellaneous

- **`WEBSITE_IMAGE_TAG`** introduced as a separate variable from `GEOVISIO_IMAGE_TAG` — the website image is on Docker Hub and needs its own tag; using the same variable caused incorrect image references when deploying non-DockerHub API images.
- **`INFRA_NB_PROXIES=2`** set explicitly — with both Traefik (Coolify) and nginx in the request path before the API, two proxy hops must be declared so Flask trusts the correct `X-Forwarded-For` header for URL generation and rate limiting.
- **`KC_DB_PASSWORD`** parameterised — replaced a hardcoded password in `1-init-keycloak-db.sh` and `docker-compose.yml` with the `KC_DB_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- **`VITE_TITLE`, `VITE_META_TITLE`, `VITE_META_DESCRIPTION`** — made configurable via environment variables with sensible defaults, instead of being hardcoded in the compose file.

---

## Backup runbook added

`BACKUP.md` — comprehensive runbook for backing up a production Panoramax instance to Backblaze B2, covering:
- PostgreSQL dumps (geovisio + keycloak schemas) encrypted with restic
- Permanent HD pictures synced S3-to-S3 with rclone (derivates deliberately excluded)
- Keycloak realm export as a portable recovery artefact
- Secrets and config backup
- Full disaster-recovery procedure
- Weekly copy to an external hard drive

---

## Backup service implemented

The `backup/` sidecar described in `BACKUP.md` §5/§7 is now wired into the stack:

- **New `backup/` directory** — `Dockerfile` (Alpine + restic, rclone, `postgresql16-client`, `supercronic`), `entrypoint.sh` (renders the cron schedule from env vars via `envsubst`), `crontab.template`, and the backup scripts (`backup-db.sh`, `backup-images.sh`, `backup-config.sh`, `backup-healthcheck.sh`, `restic-check.sh`).
- **`docker-compose.yml`** — added the `backup` service (restic repository derived from `BACKUP_S3_*`, all required secrets/credentials reused rather than re-entered), a `backup_scratch` volume for working files, and a `kc_export` volume shared with `auth` so a Coolify Scheduled Task can trigger `kc.sh export` for the portable Keycloak realm snapshot.
- **`env.example`** — documented the new `BACKUP_S3_*`, `RESTIC_PASSWORD`, `PGHOST`/`PGUSER`, `BACKUP_CRON_*`, and `RESTIC_KEEP_*` variables.

Out of scope (operational, not code): the weekly HDD copy (§8), the disaster-recovery runbook (§9), and configuring the actual Coolify Scheduled Task for the Keycloak realm export.
